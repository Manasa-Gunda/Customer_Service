Overview
This project involves building a system to generate automated responses to customer queries using a pre-existing dataset from Hugging Face. The goal is to map queries to appropriate responses efficiently.

Steps
1. Importing Necessary Libraries
We import the required libraries from the transformers and datasets packages.
2. Loading the Dataset and Tokenizer
The dataset "Kaludi/Customer-Support-Responses" is loaded using the load_dataset function. We also load the pre-trained tokenizer for the T5 model.
3. Defining the Preprocessing Function
We define a function preprocess_function to extract queries and responses from the dataset.
4. Applying the Preprocessing Function
The preprocessing function is applied to the dataset. This step removes the original columns and retains only the preprocessed queries and responses.
5. Creating a Query-Response Dictionary
We create a dictionary for fast lookup of responses based on queries.
6. Defining the Response Retrieval Function
A function get_response is defined to retrieve responses based on input queries using the dictionary created.
7. Example Query and Response Retrieval
An example query is provided, and the corresponding response is retrieved and displayed.
